# Web Trends - Assignment 2 Part 3

## Objective
Using Ngoc API - Toronto Malls to display all shopping malls using Angular 6.

## Description
I'm using NgOc API to display data. This API is available at http://api.jadeto.com/malls.php?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY  and the API key is qwertyuiop.

##API
To retrieve all the data of all the malls, only the valid API key is required for the query string. No API key results in the HTTP 401 Unauthorized client error status response code page.
 
## Models, Service, & Componet
Model malls.ts has been created and pushed to Git branch (NewModules) 

Service (malls.service.ts) & Component (folder malls) Module has been created.

## Styling
malls.component.html and associated CSS has been updated to ensure that the data from API should be viewable in formatted form on all
screen sizes without content requiring side-scrolling.

## Git
Project is pushed to Git with a branch NewModules showing each feature.
